I USED ALADHAN AS API const char* city = "Izmir"; Instead of Izmir you can write any city you want and const char* country = "Turkey"; Instead of Turkey you will need to write your own country. 
If you don't do it the api will not be able to get data according to your own country and city. 
Also capitalize the first letter of the city and country names. 
If you get a 302 error in the api you can solve the problem by sending the problem to chatgpt. 
The 302 error usually means that another esp is using that link. 
You can get the http code as 200 by updating the chatgpt code. 200 shows that data is being retrieved from the api.
